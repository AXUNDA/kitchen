> N/B :This live url is on a free server,if left idle for 1 hour,it goes to sleep ,and takes about 80 seconds to spin up once a request is sent,you may have to wait for 80 seconds to receive a response from the server for your first request.

> N/B : If you want to clone and run this locally,there is an env.example file in the root directory,that is an example of how you enviroment variables should be structured,if you need to populate your database there is a kitchen.sql file .in the commom/mockData directory,you can run it in mysqlworkbench,this server was developed with express and mysql..

cheers
